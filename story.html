"In the future…
As of yet there are been no successful attempts to change our course towards Global Warming,
as a result temperatures have been rising, there is acid rain, rising sea levels, mass extinction of vital crops and livestock, as well as unexpected and devastating natural disasters with no ozone layer, the polar ice caps have disappeared

You turn on the news and hear the daily warnings about the storms and floods, hoping that you won’t be hit this time. 
You eat your synthetic breakfast, actual fruits, vegetables, and meat are only for the rich who can pay the inflated prices.)
